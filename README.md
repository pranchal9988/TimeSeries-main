# TimeSeries
Time Series Analysis:

Time series analysis is a statistical method used to analyze and predict data that changes over time.
It involves studying patterns and trends in the data, including seasonality and cyclicality.
Time series analysis is often used in economics, finance, and weather forecasting, among other fields.
The data is plotted on a time scale to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality.
The most common time series models are ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA).

SARIMA:

SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) is a variation of ARIMA that includes seasonality.
It is used for time series data that exhibit seasonal patterns and trends.
SARIMA models take into account the seasonal component in addition to the non-seasonal component.
SARIMA models are defined by three parameters: p, d, and q for the non-seasonal component, and P, D, and Q for the seasonal component.
SARIMA models are useful for forecasting future values of a time series based on historical data.

SARIMAX:

SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables) is an extension of SARIMA that includes exogenous variables.
It is used for time series data that not only exhibit seasonal patterns but also have external factors that affect them.
SARIMAX models take into account both the seasonal and non-seasonal components as well as the influence of exogenous variables.
SARIMAX models are defined by the same parameters as SARIMA, plus an additional parameter for the exogenous variables.
SARIMAX models are useful for forecasting future values of a time series based on historical data and external factors that may affect the series.
